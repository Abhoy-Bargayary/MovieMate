## Features

Our project includes simple but useful features that make booking movie tickets easy and fun.

### Main Menu
The main menu gives users clear options to view movies, book tickets, or exit the program. It’s simple and easy to navigate.

### Movie Selection
Users first pick a movie from the list of available movies. After selecting the movie, the available showtimes for that movie are displayed in a single row, so it’s easy to choose.

### Seat Booking System
Once a showtime is selected, users can choose their seats from a cinema-style layout:
- `O` = Available seat  
- `X` = Booked seat  

Users can book multiple seats at once. Each row has different pricing:
- Row A → Platinum (₹200)  
- Row B → Gold (₹150)  
- Other rows → Silver (₹120)

### Payment Simulation
After choosing seats, users can “pay” using UPI, Card, or Cash .

### Booking Summary
Once the booking is complete, the system shows a summary including:
- Movie name  
- Selected showtime  
- Chosen seats  
- Total amount  

This gives a clear confirmation of the booking.

Overall, **MovieMate** gives a mini cinema experience in the terminal while staying beginner-friendly and simple to use.
