# MovieMate
*C++ Movie Ticket Booking System*

---

## Overview 
MovieMate is a simple C++ project we built to make booking movie tickets easy and fun.  
It uses **classes, objects, and vectors** to manage movies, showtime, seat bookings, and payments.
The main idea is to simulate a cinema experience in the terminal.
